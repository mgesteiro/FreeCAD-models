# Giggling eye
A giggling eye 3D model used in our Escornabot models. Built from scratch with [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org). Everything is better with *giggling eyes* ...

It's parametric so yo can create your own size variant by just typing the numbers. It comes with some presets (those that I have myself at hand).
