# Dupont cable
A dupont cable (or wire, or jumper) 3D model, used in many of my projects. Built from scratch with [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org).

This is the *squared* shaped header type, with the longest size i've found (the worst case scenario), used to validate assemblies. There are female and male versions.
